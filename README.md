# Assignment 1: Shopee Web Application

A node module that displays a list of items and prices in the online store, and handles the customer order processing based on the items in their cart.

In this readme file, describe how to use your node module. It could be similar to **app.js** from Lab2, where you call some functions in your node module and display the output. Describe how to call the functions, what parameters required and so on.
